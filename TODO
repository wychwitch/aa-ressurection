    ☐ inv {get} displays worth (all (public or private)item worth + (public or private)gp) @medium @30m
    ☐ inv add -i item { -b bag } { -q int } -u user @medium @15m
        (gives specified user the item, player has to have item to give it unless they're dm)
    ☐ Make (or find) a function that easily takes string and sends to the channel, and make it where it stores the last message in a global variable. @medium @created(21-09-24 11:37)

        Deletes the last message by bot 
    ☐ inv add -i item -w [1yp/1 yp] @high @30m
        add an item with specified worth. Will need a function to parse the "1gp / 1 gp" as tuple (1, "gp")
    ☐ inv add --bulk -i item1 -i item2 -i item3 -p @low  @1h
        bulk item add, optional q with reach one (possibly, worry about that last) into specified bag, also tags all public or private if needed. Will need to have its own function i think.

    ☐ inv remove -i item { -q int } { user } @high @10m

    ☐ inv remove -b bag { -d } { user } @high @10m
        removes bag from all items, if -d is passed destroys items in bag as well 
    ☐ inv move -i item, {-b bag} { -u user } @high  @15m
        Moves item to the bag, or just out of bag if no bag is supplied
    ☐ inv move -f bag {-t bag}  { -u user } @high @15m

    ☐ Test for input error handling + good error reporting @low @created(21-09-23 13:31) @3h
    ☐ move the majority of the script to their own script files and import them @medium @created(21-09-24 18:02)
        (its way way too hard to keep track)
