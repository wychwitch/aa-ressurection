Goals for rewrite:

* Make Bot Function
* Reduce json bloat (unused files, files that can be combined with others, etc)
  * Also rename the json files so they make sense. Im looking at you dicti that should be quotes.json
* Rewrite bot in a way that future possible upgrades might be better (put the code that touches discord in their own functions?? hmmm not sure about this one m8)
