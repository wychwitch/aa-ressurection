[Migrating to 1.0 documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrating.html)

Goals for rewrite:

* Make Bot Function
* Remove some of the redundant json/text files
* Rewrite bot in a way that future possible upgrades might be better (put the code that touches discord in their own functions?? hmmm not sure about this one m8)
